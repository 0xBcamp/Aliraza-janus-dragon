# Chain Fusion Decentralize Identity Kit

This decentralize identity kit simplifies the process of managing and verifying users' identities digitally.

This includes the following use cases:

### Creating DIDs (Decentralize Identifiers)
DIDs are kind of identifiers for users that will be assosiated with their private keys, totally owned and governed by them. Users can create as many DIDs they want, each of which represents separate profiles for their credentials.

### Issue VCs (Verifiable Credentials)
